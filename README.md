# **Eclipse Attack Detection in Ethereum Blockchain Network Layer**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on **detecting Eclipse Attacks** in the Ethereum blockchain network layer using **machine learning techniques**. An Eclipse Attack disrupts the connectivity of blockchain nodes, isolating them from the network. This project addresses the issue by analyzing network traffic patterns to detect anomalies effectively.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Data Collection**: Utilized **Etherscan API** to gather Ethereum transaction data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Derived critical network traffic features essential for identifying anomalous patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Built a robust ML model to differentiate between legitimate and suspicious transactions.
- **Efficient Detection**: Achieved enhanced accuracy in identifying Eclipse Attack attempts.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
- **Blockchain API**: Etherscan API

---

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Fetched transaction data from [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) using the Etherscan API.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaned and structured raw data for analysis.
3. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - Identified key features such as transaction volume, frequency, and address behavior.
4. **Model Development**:
   - Designed and trained machine learning models for anomaly detection.
5. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Validated the model’s accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
6. **Improvement**:
   - Fine-tuned the model based on evaluation results to ensure optimal performance.

---

## **Results**
- Enhanced detection of **legitimate vs. suspicious transactions**.
- Provided an efficient solution to mitigate Eclipse Attack risks in Ethereum’s network layer.
